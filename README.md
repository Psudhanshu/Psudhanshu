# 🧔🏻 About Me

📁 I am Sudhanshu Pawar, a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer. I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University, building expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Engineering.

💻 I am working on projects in predictive analytics, deep learning, and multi-agent systems, with hands-on experience in tools like Python, SQL, Tableau, and Google Colab. I aspire to specialize in Generative Neural Networks and contribute to cutting-edge research in the field.

🏛️ My journey into programming began with creating games in Unity, followed by exploring web development with React. This evolved into a passion for Data Science, where I now focus on implementing machine learning models and developing scalable data solutions.

🎢 Outside of tech, I enjoy creativity and learning new skills, such as playing guitar, sketching, and designing graphics. I have contributed to newsletter creation and enjoy crafting engaging content.
